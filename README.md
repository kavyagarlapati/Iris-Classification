# Iris Flower Classification

A supervised machine learning project that classifies Iris flowers into three species based on sepal and petal measurements.

This project was developed during the **Machine Learning Training Program conducted by Codinza**, focusing on foundational supervised learning techniques and practical implementation using Scikit-learn.

## Project Overview

The objective of this project is to build a classification model capable of predicting the species of an Iris flower using the following features:

* Sepal Length
* Sepal Width
* Petal Length
* Petal Width

The project demonstrates the end-to-end machine learning workflow including data exploration, preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.

## Dataset

The project uses the built-in Iris dataset available in Scikit-learn.

Dataset characteristics:

* 150 total samples
* 3 classes:

  * Iris Setosa
  * Iris Versicolor
  * Iris Virginica
* 4 numerical features

The dataset is commonly used as a benchmark for classification tasks in machine learning.
